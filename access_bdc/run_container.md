# Run a container

## Start a new container

Open a new terminal and run `bdstart CONTAINERNAME`

All containers available can be autocompleted if you type the first letter followed by the `Tab` command (e.g. `bdstart d[+Tab]`).

Alternatively, you can execute (double click) the `app.sh` file locate in the folder of each container. It will start the container in a new terminal.&#x20;

### Use the container

After starting the container, the terminal will show all services available (i.e. Jupyter Lab, RStudio or Linuxserver). Open the link of the server you need on a web browser.

## Close container

You close the container terminal by pressing `Ctrl + d`
